## Project Title: Integrating Machine Learning and Spaceborne Laser Altimetry to Quantify Uncertainty in Vegetation Height Estimation in Dryland Vegetation

## Abstract
Drylands cover about 40\% of Earth’s land surface and store substantial carbon, but their low, sparse vegetation and steep terrain make canopy height difficult to measure, especially from space. We use ICESat-2 and GEDI data, coupled with airborne lidar, to estimate shrub-dominated canopy height in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW), Idaho. After harmonizing all datasets to a common horizontal and vertical datum, independent (t)-tests at RCEW and a second site in Twin Falls show no significant elevation bias between the airborne and spaceborne lidar. We then coregister GEDI footprints and ICESat-2 ATL08 segments with a kd-tree nearest-neighbor search under strict spatial and temporal constraints. We evaluate the performance of four ensembles: Random Forest, Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and autoDEUQ. Deep Ensembles give the best performance for both sensors (RMSE $\approx 0.62-0.83~m$, $R^2\approx 0.88$), with MCD and RF close behind; autoDEUQ is less accurate but yields the most context-sensitive uncertainty estimates. Permutation importance shows that lidar structural metrics (e.g., GEDI foliage-height diversity, ICESat-2 photon bin and photon-count variables) are the most important predictors, while slope and geographic coordinates are less important once these features are included. Using airborne canopy height and slope aggregated to GEDI and ICESat-2 ATL08 footprints, we find that errors increase with terrain steepness and are generally larger for ICESat-2 than for GEDI, reflecting differences in footprint geometry, sampling pattern, and sensitivity to topography. Overall, the study demonstrates that combining machine learning, spaceborne lidar, and airborne benchmarks can resolve sub-meter vegetation structure in drylands.
